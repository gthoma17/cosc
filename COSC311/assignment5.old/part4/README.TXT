Pt4 is about recursion in BST structure. Write tree class as follows. Tree elements are integers. Has the following public methods:
a) constructor, creates array from given array of 20 integers
b) nodes() counts  the nodes in the tree
c) leaves() method that prints the leaves in the tree
d) height() computes height of the tree
e) odd() finds sum of all odd values in tree
f) zero() checks if tree contains zero
g) descend() prints values in descending order
h) ascend() prints values in ascending order
i) minimum computes the minimum value in the tree
j) greater method prints all values greater or equal to given value in tree
k) level method computes the level of a given value in tree

All methods need efficient run time. Methods (b)-(l) must be based on recursion and not have loops
Public methods may call private helper methods.

Write a menu based main program that allows user to user tree class and its methods
